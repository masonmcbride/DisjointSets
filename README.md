# DisjointSets
Disjoints Sets

Disjoint Sets have two functions: connect() and isConnected()
This repo has many different implementations, both naive and sophisticated, for learning purposes.

Implementation of a Quick Union for Disjoint Sets. Connected() and isConnected() operations take O(n) time.
Implementation of a Weighted Quick Union for Disjoint Sets. Connected() and isConnected() operations take O(logn) time.
